# Cursor-Snap
Cursor Snap is a lightweight utility that tracks your mouse cursor position. If the cursor remains still for a set duration (default 1 second), the app saves the position. Pressing a hotkey moves the cursor back to the last saved position.
## Features

- Tracks mouse cursor position when idle
- Saves the last idle position
- Press a hotkey to return the cursor to the saved position
- Customize hotkeys and idle time
